    /* That means:
     * We simulate (mock) the behavior of dependencies (interfaces, services, repositories, etc.) 
     * without needing real implementations.
     * 
     * WHY? / HOW?
     * - When you call mock(GreetingService.class), Mockito creates a fake object that implements the interface for you.
     * - This mock object allows you to:
     *          - control the return values (when().thenReturn())
     *          - verify if methods were called (verify())
     *          - simulate exceptions (thenThrow())
     *          
     * So, you donâ€™t need to write any real class that implements the interface.
     * 
     * 
     * As backend worker, you will often mock:
     *      - Repository interfaces (e.g. Spring Data JPA)
     *      - Service interfaces
     *      - External API clients
     *      - Other collaborators
     *  ðŸ‘‰ This allows you to unit test your class in full isolation.
